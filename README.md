# CloudCast Weather App

## Overview

CloudCast is an innovative iOS weather application developed as part of the CodePath iOS Application Development course. This project focuses on the foundational aspects of iOS app development, including UI design, data modeling, and the integration of real-time data. Designed with Swift and utilizing Xcode, CloudCast delivers weather forecasts in a visually appealing and user-friendly format.

## Features

* User Interface Design: Utilizes Storyboard and Interface Builder for crafting an intuitive and engaging user interface.
* AutoLayout for Responsive Design: Implements AutoLayout constraints to ensure the app is adaptable and looks great on all device sizes.
* Data Model Integration: Introduces a WeatherForecast data model to encapsulate and manage forecast data efficiently.
* Dynamic UI Updates: Connects UI components to Swift code through IBOutlet and IBAction, allowing for dynamic updates based on user interactions.
* Real-Time Weather Data: (To be implemented) Aims to fetch and display real-time weather data using external APIs, providing accurate forecasts to users.

## Learning Objectives

Through the development of CloudCast, I aimed to deepen my understanding of:
* The process of building a UI with Interface Builder.
* The importance and application of AutoLayout for responsive design.
* The role of data models in organizing and managing application data.
* The mechanics of linking UI elements to code to create interactive applications.

## Project Status

Currently, the app's UI has been developed with static data. The next phase involves integrating an API to display real-time weather information.

## Installation

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open CloudCast.xcodeproj in Xcode.
- Run the app in the simulator or on a real device.
